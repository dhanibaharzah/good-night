# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

### System version
- Ruby  `3.0.0`
- Rails `7.0.4.3`

### Database initialization
We use SQLite3 for development and test environments.

- Run `rails db:migrate` to create the database.
- Run `rails db:seed` to populate the database with some data.


### How to run locally
- Run `rails s` to start the server.
- Run `rails c` to open the console.

It will open the server on `localhost:3000`.

You can test it in the Postman app and use this collections: https://solar-desert-450031.postman.co/workspace/My-Workspace~807d45b9-4a3f-40ea-869f-ed95144d3acf/collection/11525171-80ebf613-5f60-4ac5-82fc-9ed66f683824?action=share&creator=11525171
